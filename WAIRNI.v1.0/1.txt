Các Phần chính :
0. The problem is the "illusion" that it was right. (in stopping the process of getting information about
the function, because the computer cannot get infinite information).
1. What is "wave", what is area (Rule)?
2. How the "wave" forms are converted to "wave law" form for comparison (Rule)?
3. Details on how to "draw" tangent lines for "measurement points/locations" located on the "wave".
4. How to calculate?
5. Hưng Wave Analysis's Goal.
6. Numerical Integration.
7. Hưng Wave Analysis.
8. How to apply Hung_WAIRNI in practice?
