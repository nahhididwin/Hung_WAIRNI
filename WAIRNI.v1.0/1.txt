Các Phần chính :
0. The problem is the "illusion" that it was right. (in stopping the process of getting information about
the function, because the computer cannot get infinite information).
1. What is "wave", what is area (Rule)?
2. How the "wave" forms are converted to "wave law" form for comparison (Rule)?
3. Details on how to "draw" tangent lines for "measurement points/locations" located on the "wave".
4. How to calculate?
5. Hưng Wave Analysis's Goal.
6. Numerical Integration.
7. Hưng Wave Analysis.
8. How to apply Hung_WAIRNI in practice?

Rules :
1. What is "wave", what is area?
Xem ảnh pic_0_2.png;
Calculating the area of a non-linear shape is easy if you "draw/approximate" the "wave" of the shape exactly. So the problem
will be the "wave".



2. How the "wave" forms are converted to "wave law" form for comparison:

Good Case: α_1 > α_2 * 2
Required (Always) :
Đường tiếp tuyến sẽ phải cắt nhau (2 đường cắt nhau), (Tiếp tuyến không song song với nhau), nếu không thì chỗ đó xài phương pháp khác, ex :
Simpson's Rule,...
